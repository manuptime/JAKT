NOTES:
Client:

Testing:
        MOCHA::
                Mocha is the test runner and and utility belt for testing. It's everything except an actual assertion library

                Install mocha - `npm install -g mocha`
                run `mocha` to run tests.


        CHAI::
                Chai is the assertion library

                Install chai - `npm install chai`
                require it in your test code, ie `var assert = require('chai').assert



       MAKE::
                I'm going to make a make script sooner or later.



       WRITING TESTS:::
                Because coffeescript wraps everything in a function, we need to make sure to attach exports to the exports object when running for tests
                ie if exports?: exports.foo = foo...
