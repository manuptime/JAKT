We use what we (think we) know about you to show you videos we think you’ll like, then learn from your experience so we can show you even better ones. We take all of that (what we think we know about you, and what you did in the game), take out anything like your name that identifies you personally, and report to brands how their campaigns performed.\n          <br>\n          <br>\n          We get data from a few places. First, Free Awesome tells us some of what you’ve told them. Then we use services like Rapleaf, Bluekai, and others to learn a bit more about you, such as how old you might be and where you might live — we won’t know for sure, unless you tell us. If you’ve played before, we’ll know how you did in the game. Soon we’ll start learning in the most innovative way we know — by asking you. We could ask things like “Do you like ice skating?” or “Do you have a pet?” or “Do you have an ice skating pet?”\n          <br>\n          <br>\n          Our goal with all this data stuff is to personalize your experience and show you better videos. Because we hate having to see videos we don’t care about, and we imagine you feel the same. And if we show you stuff you like, your happiness will show up in our data, and advertisers will be happy, and they’ll keep paying, so you can keep unlocking. That’s pretty much the deal. We also want to transplant your brain into a robot body, but so far no one’s survived the procedure. Still trying, though!  \n          <br>\n          <br>\n          <span class=\"info-text-title\">Thanks, but I’d rather stay incognito. Will you delete your record of me?</span>\n          <br>\n          Sure! We’re working on simple ways for you to control your profile, but they’re not ready yet. In the meantime, email us at <a href=\"mailto:privacy@unlockable.com\" class=\"info-text-link\">privacy@unlockable.com</a> with the email address you used to sign up for Free Awesome and we’ll forget we ever knew you, though we may have a good cry first.\n          <br>\n          <br>\n          <span class=\"info-text-title\">I’ve got some thoughts. How do I talk to you about them?</span>\n          <br>\n          Glad we asked on your behalf. If something doesn’t work, or if you think it could work better, we want to hear it.
