        <div class="info">
          <span class="info-text-title">What is this?</span>
          <br>
          This is Unlockable, a game of nice ads. Play to unlock more Free Awesome tokens for free!
          <br>
          <br>
          <span class="info-text-title">How do I unlock Free Awesome tokens?</span>
          <br>
          We give you a playlist of video games (that is to say, games with videos in them), and once you earn enough points, you win 40 tokens. Each game is worth up to 50,000 points!
          <br>
          <br>
          <span class="info-text-title">What are the games?</span>
          <br>
          <span class="info-text-underline">Puzzle</span> – A video breaks into pieces, and you reconnect them before the video ends
          <br>
          <span class="info-text-underline">Sort ‘Em</span> – Watch a video, then sort photos from it into timeline order
          <br>
          <span class="info-text-underline">Dropblocks</span> – Guide the blocks to fall into the right spots (think of it as a falling block video puzzle)
          <br>
          <span class="info-text-underline">Trivia</span> – Watch a video, and don’t forget to remember
          <br>
          <br>
          <span class="info-text-title">How long are the games?</span>
          <br>
          Each game lasts 30 seconds to a minute or so. And they’re fun! You won’t even think about how long they are, unless you’re on a tight deadline and are procrastinating.
          <br>
          <br>
          <span class="info-text-title">Do I have to buy something?</span>
          <br>
          Nope. No signups, no credit cards, no long surveys, nada.
          <br>
          <br>
          <span class="info-text-title">Are you harvesting all my data and selling to the highest bidder?</span>
          <br>
            <div class="info-text-img-div">
              <img class="info-text-img" src="../../../media/img/racoon.png" alt="evil-plotting-racoon">
            </div>
          That is to say, no we’re not, but we do want to tell you all about how we handle data.
          <br>
          <br>
          <span class="info-text-title">How does Unlockable get and use data?</span>
          <br>
          For the full scoop, read our <a href="#terms-conditions" class="info-text-link">Terms of Use</a> and <a href="#privacy" class="info-text-link">Privacy Policy</a>, but we’ll put the key points here. We use what we (think we) know about you to show you videos we think you’ll like, then learn from your experience so we can show you even better ones. We take all of that (what we think we know about you, and what you did in the game), take out anything like your name that identifies you personally, and report to brands how their campaigns performed.
          <br>
          <br>
          We get data from a few places. First, Free Awesome tells us some of what you’ve told them. Then we use services like Rapleaf, Bluekai, and others to learn a bit more about you, such as how old you might be and where you might live — we won’t know for sure, unless you tell us. If you’ve played before, we’ll know how you did in the game. Soon we’ll start learning in the most innovative way we know — by asking you. We could ask things like “Do you like ice skating?” or “Do you have a pet?” or “Do you have an ice skating pet?”
          <br>
          <br>
          Our goal with all this data stuff is to personalize your experience and show you better videos. Because we hate having to see videos we don’t care about, and we imagine you feel the same. And if we show you stuff you like, your happiness will show up in our data, and advertisers will be happy, and they’ll keep paying, so you can keep unlocking. That’s pretty much the deal. We also want to transplant your brain into a robot body, but so far no one’s survived the procedure. Still trying, though!  
          <br>
          <br>
          <span class="info-text-title">Thanks, but I’d rather stay incognito. Will you delete your record of me?</span>
          <br>
          Sure! We’re working on simple ways for you to control your profile, but they’re not ready yet. In the meantime, email us at <a href="mailto:privacy@unlockable.com" class="info-text-link">privacy@unlockable.com</a> with the email address you used to sign up for Free Awesome and we’ll forget we ever knew you, though we may have a good cry first.
          <br>
          <br>
          <span class="info-text-title">I’ve got some thoughts. How do I talk to you about them?</span>
          <br>
          Glad we asked on your behalf. If something doesn’t work, or if you think it could work better, we want to hear it. We’ll be making it easier to get in touch with us, but for now, send questions, comments, love letters, hate mail, and indifference emoji to <a href="mailto:feedback@unlockable.com"  class="info-text-link">feedback@unlockable.com</a>.

          <br>
          Regardless of where our servers are located, your personal data will be processed by us in the United States, where data protection and privacy regulations may or may not be to the same level of protection as in other parts of the world. BY VISITING THE SERVICE, YOU UNEQUIVOCALLY AND UNAMBIGUOUSLY CONSENT TO THE COLLECTION AND PROCESSING IN THE UNITED STATES OF ANY INFORMATION COLLECTED OR OBTAINED BY US THROUGH VOLUNTARY SUBMISSIONS, AND THAT U.S. LAW GOVERNS ANY SUCH COLLECTION AND PROCESSING.

          <span class="info-text-title">Information Collected</span>
          <br>
          We collect two types of information about persons who use the Service: personal information and non-personal information.

          <br>
          <span class="info-text-title">Personal Information Collected</span>
          <br>
          Personal information is information that would permit us to contact you, or serves as a persistent identifier of you within Unlockable.
          <br>
          Personal Information that we may collect includes:
          <p class="info-text-indent">

          <br>
          <br>
          <span class="info-text-title">Non-Personal Information</span>
          <br>
          Non-Personal Information is information about you, other than Personal Information, that may be collected by Unlockable. It may include non-personal information about how you use the Service, such as browsing habits, information about the referring source of your traffic, your anonymous demographic details, your interactions with the Service and analytics relating to your use of the Service. If you request, the Service may include accessing other data on your device, such as your contacts and calendar, for the purpose of fulfilling specific requests.
          <br>
          <br>
          If you integrate your use of the Service with social media, such as Facebook or LinkedIn, Unlockable may collect additional information about you from those sources, such as self-reported data, interests and social connections. This information may be supplemented through third-party database vendors.
          <br>
          <br>
          <span class="info-text-title">Third-Party Collection</span>
          <br>
          Our Service may use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. (“Google”). Google Analytics uses cookies, to help us analyze how users use the Service. You may be able to opt-out of Google’s collection. Please visit Google’s <a class="info-text-link" href="http://google.com/settings/ads/">Ads Preferences Manager</a> or the <a class="info-text-link" href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/">Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on</a> for more information.
          <br>
          <br>
          The Service may also use cookies for its own analytics.

          <span class="info-text-title">Internal Use of Information by Unlockable</span>
          <br>
          We accept and gather information in an effort to provide you with the Service. This includes the internal use of your information to tailor the Services to your interests and improve the user experience of the Services. Additionally, Unlockable may use your information for administration of the Service, such as for communicating with you about the Services, Unlockable’s associates, or offers from Unlockable and its associates.
          <br>
          <br>
          <span class="info-text-title">Sharing Information with Third-Parties, Consultants, and Affiliates</span>
          <br>
          We may share your information with our consultants and affiliates in order for us to provide you with the Service and to operate Unlockable. For instance, our internet service provider and web host may have access to your data to perform their services for Unlockable. Further, Unlockable may retain third-party consultants to perform analysis on your data and to otherwise provide consulting services to Unlockable that may include review of your data. These types of disclosures will be on a confidential basis.
          <br>
          <br>
          Unlockable may share your Non-Personal Information with our business associates and advertising partners. Such sharing is generally for the purpose of marketing Unlockable’s own services and to discuss and offer Unlockable’s services to advertisers that may wish to participate in the Unlockable platform.
          <br>
          <br>
          In certain identified circumstances, select offers or programs being promoted or offered through Unlockable require the disclosure of your Personal Information to third-party advertisers or business associates. This is generally where Unlockable’s business associate requires this information for eligibility to participate in a program, giveaway or offer. Your participation in such a program is voluntary, and you will be given notice of the sharing of Personal Information in this context.
          <br>
          <br>
          Further, we may disclose collected information to the extent we believe it necessary to comply with the law, such as in response to a subpoena or court order, to defend a legal claim or otherwise as permitted by applicable law. Additionally, we may transfer your information to successor in interest, which may include but may not be limited to a third-party in the event of an acquisition, sale, merger or bankruptcy.
          <br>
          <br>
          <span class="info-text-title">Access and Control</span>
          <br>
          Unlockable may provide you with the ability to access the Personal Information we have collected about you. It is our intention to expand this ability over time. At present, if you would like us to delete your data, please contact us at <a class="info-text-link" href="mailto:privacy@unlockable.com?subject=Account Deletion">privacy@unlockable.com</a> and your request will be taken under advisement.
          <br>
          <br>
          <span class="info-text-title">Links and Integration</span>
          <br>
          Our Service may contain links to other services or may be integrated into the websites or services of third-parties. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites or services. When you leave our Service to visit another website, application or service, please read such third-party’s privacy statements. This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by Unlockable through the Service.
          <br>
          <br>
          <span class="info-text-title">Security</span>
          <br>
          We employ procedural and technical safeguards to secure your personal information against loss, theft, alteration, and unauthorized access, use and disclosure. We also employ security procedures to protect your information from unauthorized access by users inside and outside the company. These measures include password protection, firewalls, encryption and similar methods.
          <br>
          <br>
          Regardless of the precautions taken by Unlockable, No transmission of data over the Internet is guaranteed to be completely secure. It may be possible for third parties not under our control to intercept or access transmissions or private communications unlawfully. While we strive to protect personal information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us.
          <br>
          <br>
          <span class="info-text-title">Children and Privacy</span>
          <br>
          We do not knowingly permit users if they are under 13 years old, and therefore do not request personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13. If we become aware that a customer is under the age of 13 and has provided us with personal information without prior verifiable parental consent, we will remove his or her personally identifiable registration information from our files. If you are the parent or guardian of a person under the age of 13 who has provided personally identifiable information to us without your approval, please inform us by contacting us at the e-mail address below.

          <span class="info-text-title">California Privacy Rights</span>
          <br>
          California law allows California residents to request information regarding our disclosures in the prior calendar year, if any, of their personally identifiable information to third parties. To make such a request, please contact us at <a class="info-text-link" href="mailto:privacy@unlockable.com?subject=Request for Privacy Info">privacy@unlockable.com</a> with "Request for Privacy Information" in the subject line.
