Ben Things to do:

 - TIMER - Dynamic injection of degree units based off total time ie 30s, 20s, whatever
 - TIMER TRIVIA - Pause timer and add incorrect or correct when on answered question screen for trivia, remove and continue timer
 - All questions on trivia questions screen carry to answered screen so we can animate unselected and right/wrong
 - Frames - timeout for submit button to allow for animations followed by kick to next screen( not a priorty )
 - Hashing URL to jump to different states of app
