The following Images were taken directly out of the game running on an iPad (in this case the iPad Simulator).  Below each image is a text description about what you are seeing.
<IMG SRC="loading.png">
<BR>
This is the startup screen.  I'm working on a new version with the Roller coaster inlace of this, but it's not in the actual game yet.
<BR>
<IMG SRC="mainmenu.png">
<BR>
This is the main menu.  You can access Settings and a Chapter select from the icons at the top.  The Play button at the bottom will start at Activity 1.
<BR>
<IMG SRC="chapterselect.png">
<BR>
This is where you can select a chapter, the list scrolls to the left and right.<BR>
<IMG SRC="introtextpage1.png">
<BR>
This is the first page of Introduction text.  There is an intro page before each Activity.<BR>
<IMG SRC="introtextpage2.png">
<BR>
This is the 2nd intro page, this is where the large graphic is going (that's why it is blank, the graphics haven't been added to the game yet).<BR>
<IMG SRC="activity1_1.png">
<BR>
This is the first question in Activity 1.  You drag the right emotion to the right character.  The characters come in from the left and right into position.  It will play a Firework particle when you get one right.<BR>
<IMG SRC="activity1_next.png">
<BR>
Once you get all the questions right, a Next button appears.  When you get a question wrong, the character will shake, and the choice you selected will return to it's original location on the board.<BR>
<IMG SRC="activity1_2.png">
<BR>
This is the 2nd Question on activity 1.<BR>
<IMG SRC="fireworks.png">
<BR>
The fire work particles in action.  It's hard to grab a screenshot.  Please not, it's not a final design, just a test particle to make sure it works.<BR>

This is Activity 2.  Right now it's just using assets from Activity 1, as I get the positions correct.  Then I will put in the Activity 2 Assets.  The activity will list 5 questions on the Left, and 5 answers on the right, and you have to match them in the right order.  Again, pay no attention to the actual images in this, it's all about making the logic work.

These Next Images, are being implemented, these are the sketches of how they should work in game.

<BR>
This is the first version of the Question and Answer mode.  This puts an question in the center, and images with captions around it.
<BR>
<IMG SRC="Mode4.005.jpg">
<BR>
This version of the Question and Answer mode will have single question question in text, and several answers around it.  This will power the final activity.
<BR>
<IMG SRC="Mode4.009.jpg">
<BR>
This mode, presents a question with an image and a caption in the center of the screen and several possible answers around it.  Correct answers highlight green, incorrect answers turn red.  It takes 5 correct answers to correctly complete this activity.
<BR>
<BR>
The only remaining Activity not present in this list, is the "Slide Show" activity, where it presents an image and text, and a Next Button.  That is going into the program last.
